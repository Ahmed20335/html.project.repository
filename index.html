  <h1>Pros and Cons of Artificial Intelligence</h1>
  Advantages of Artificial Intelligence
(1) Zero human error
This is why the adoption of artificial intelligence in various domains has shot up. When you can nullify human errors completely, you get accurate results. The catch is, to program properly.

Machines take accurate decisions based on the previous information that they gather over time while applying certain algorithm sets. Thus, there is a reduction in error and a spike in accuracy.

For instance, Google recently shared on its AI blog about a machine learning method that will work around predicting the weather. Google is going to call it ‘Nowcasting‘ which will predict weather zero tp six hours ahead of time. Google believes by using fewer data and simple methodology, they can predict weather more accurately, especially in events like thunderstorms or ones related to precipitation.


(2) Zero risks
Putting machines into tasks that can be a danger to humans can pay off well. For instance, enabling machines to deal with natural calamity can result in faster recovery and lesser pressure on human teams.

This idea comes riding high on Google and Harvard’s initiative of developing an AI system that can predict the aftershock locations of an earthquake. After studying over 131,000 earthquakes and its aftershocks, scientists have tested this neural network on 30,000 events. It showed more accuracy in pinpointing aftershock locations when pitted against traditional methods.


(3) Round-the-clock availability
It is obvious that machines don’t get tired. Machines can work endlessly without breaks and don’t even get bored doing the same thing repeatedly, unlike a human.

In November last year, Google announced Contact Center AI for businesses to improve customer experience. This is a classic example of an AI-enabled helpline system for businesses to relentlessly address customer queries and issues, and resolve them on priority for improved customer experience.

Similarly, Amazon Lex, the chatbot designed for call center by Amazon is capable of having intelligent conversations against human queries. It incorporates the same technology of Amazon Alexa – i.e. to recognize the caller’s intent, ask related follow-up questions, and provide answers. These chatbots are available round-the-clock catering to customers across the globe and varied timezones seamlessly.


(4) AI machines have no emotions
Machines have no emotions [well, unless you are Chitti, the robot, that, quite frankly, had me confused with its obsession over the female protagonist Sana]. This single attribute about Ai-enabled machines can help you deal with customer grievances more steadily.

Imagine a feature in your software not functioning suddenly causing inconvenience to your users. They will surely raise tickets, ping on your chat support and write emails. Often people attempt for ‘live chat’ rather than waiting on email or tickets to get resolved.

Now imagine having a human at the receiving end, who fully understands the issues and is trying hard to resolve queries in hundreds of numbers. At one point, that person will break. Chances are chats that may go hay-way in terms of sensitivity of language.

However, with an AI-enabled chat system, no such breaking point arises. Customers can throw any amount of weird queries, your chatbot has pre-fed answers that it will keep on showing as per its assessment of query.

It is definitely one of the safest ways to handle such scenarios because machines don’t feel anything. They will only analyze the words used in the query, matching them against the pre-fed information, and give out relevant answers.

(5) AI-machines can take decisions fast
Using artificial intelligence and other technologies can help make machines that can make data-driven decisions much faster than humans.

Why trust a machine’s decisions?

Simple – it is devoid of any emotions and biased views. When a human takes a decision, a lot of it it is driven by emotions. A machine, on the other hand, is highly practical and rational in its approach. This ensures more accurate and result-oriented decision-making.

For instance, IBM’s Deep Blue supercomputer takes decisions based on all the probabilities possible from the opponent’s end. A human cannot fathom so many probabilities in one go like a machine.

Disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence
(6) AI-enabled machines incur heavy costs
Looking at the complexity an AI-enabled machine handles, it makes sense that AI-driven initiatives can be heavy on pockets. Creating a machine that can mimic human logic and reasoning requires plenty of resources and time, making it quite costly.

(7) Machines lack creativity
The issue with machines is that it functions as programmed. While artificial intelligence has made machines capable of learning over time, they cannot learn to think outside the box. A machine will always analyze a situation in terms of pre-fed data and past experiences. It is difficult for a machine to be creative in its approach.

One of the classic examples is the Forbes earning reports. Forbes uses Quil, a bot, to write these reports. These reports are facts and data that are pre-fed to the bot. Forrester predicts that such bot-driven contents may replace 16 percent of jobs in the US by 2025 but it is a debatable topic.

The problem with this bot-written article is that it lacks the human touch, unlike other Forbes articles. The creative touch to explaining events and use cases while writing an article is not present when a machine does it.

This analogy leads us to the next pointer.

(8) AI-enabled machines may kill job employments
AI is replacing majority of repetitive tasks with bots. The need for human interference is going down as businesses look towards more error-free and risk-free work. Add to this; machines bring speed with it. This has resulted in the killing of many job opportunities that were once prevalent. Job roles like simple data entry or talking to customers in the first touchpoint i.e. chat supports are now handled by bots that can do it more effectively and round-the-clock.

A two-year-long study by McKinsey has suggested that by 2030 robots will replace at least 30 percent of human labour, i.e., almost 400 to 800 million jobs that will require 375 million people to switch jobs.

That’s huge and scary.


(9) No emotions can be daunting at times
While this is one of the key benefits of artificial intelligence, it is also a con of artificial intelligence. Machines cannot bond with humans, because they do not have emotions or sympathy. While machine learning and NLP has helped brands set up initial customer support through bot-enabled chat systems, they still require a human of blood and flesh to intervene at one point to resolve an ongoing issue.

If the whole of it is left to bots, customer experience across the globe will go downhill. Bots can do the initial touch basing. If customers query is resolved through pre-fed guide documents, great. If not, a ticket is automatically raised by the bot for a human to manually follow up.

Sometimes, a bot cannot understand your pain point because you do not emotionally drive it. You will always need a human ear to get things done.

(10) AI-enabled machines do not understand ethics
Another human feature that is hard to incorporate inside a machine – ethics. Morality is absent in a machine and it is also hard to design and convey through technology. Artificial intelligence can help businesses cut down the time taken to complete a monotonous task but expecting a machine to follow ethical values is as vague as drawing sketches on water.

That is a human trait, and I might add, an exclusive one that too.

Summary – Benefits of Artificial Intelligence
If we see closely, the disadvantages of artificial intelligence lie solely in the fact that AI-enabled machines are not humans. If I have to sum up this whole benefits and risks of artificial intelligence, I’d say, machines have the power to do tasks at a higher speed, with more accuracy, and in lesser time. But we might still be far enough from that day when machines will start emoting like us humans.

AI may replace a few job roles temporarily, but overall it will increase global productivity and there will always be a need for humans. From history, we can draw some parallels on how the invention of steam engines shifted the manual workforce and led to the industrial revolution.

Despite that, the importance of artificial intelligence and its impact on global industries is undeniable. Every day it is growing by leaps and bounds to automate daily tasks while being agile and driving sustainability for businesses.

This certainly calls form upskilling and the need for AI literacy to succeed in new-age jobs. If you are planning to learn applied AI and machine learning, the core concepts required to build these amazing bots, get started today with AnalytixLabs, because trust me, there has never been a better time today to get into AI.

<h1>Examples of Artificial Intelligence</h1>
What is Artificial Intelligence Used for Today?
Several examples of artificial intelligence impact our lives today. These include FaceID on iPhones, the search algorithm on Google, and the recommendation algorithm on Netflix. You’ll also find other examples of how AI is in use today on social media, digital assistants like Alexa, and ride-hailing apps such as Uber.

1. Face Detection and Recognition Technology
Virtual filters on Snapchat and the FaceID unlock on iPhones are two examples of AI applications today. While the former uses face detection technology to identify any face, the latter relies on face recognition.

So, how does it work?

The TrueDepth camera on the Apple devices projects over 30,000 invisible dots to create a depth map of your face. It also captures an infrared image of the user’s face.

Apple FaceID technology reveal during the iPhone X launch in 2017.
Apple’s FaceID technology helps protect the information users store in their iPhone and iPad Pro. Face ID uses the TrueDepth camera and machine learning for a secure authentication solution. | Still shot from the iPhone X launch in 2017. | Apple
After that, a machine learning algorithm compares the scan of your face with what a previously enrolled facial data. That way, it can determine whether to unlock the device or not.

According to Apple, FaceID automatically adapts to changes in the user’s appearance. These include wearing cosmetic makeup, growing facial hair, or wearing hats, glasses, or contact lens.

The Cupertino-based tech giant also stated that the chance of fooling FaceID is one in a million.

2. Text Editor
Several text editors today rely on artificial intelligence to provide the best writing experience.

For example, document editors use an NLP algorithm to identify incorrect grammar usage and suggest corrections. Besides auto-correction, some writing tools also provide readability and plagiarism grades.

However, editors such as INK took AI usage a bit further to provide specialized functions. It uses artificial intelligence to offer smart web content optimization recommendations.

Just recently, INK has released a study showing how its AI-powered writing platform can improve content relevance and help drive traffic to sites. You can read their full study here.

3. Social Media
Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram rely heavily on artificial intelligence for various tasks.

Currently, these social media platforms use AI to personalize what you see on your feeds. The model identifies users’ interests and recommends similar content to keep them engaged.

Social media networks use artificial intelligence algorithms to personalize user feeds and filter unnecessary information like hate speech and posts inciting violence and discrimination. | 200degrees/Pixabay.com
Also, researchers trained AI models to recognize hate keywords, phrases, and symbols in different languages. That way, the algorithm can swiftly take down social media posts that contain hate speech.

Other examples of artificial intelligence in social media include:

Emoji as part of predictive text
Facial recognition to automatically tag friends in photos
Smart filter to identify and remove spam messages
Smart replies for quickly responding to messages
Plans for social media platform involve using artificial intelligence to identify mental health problems. For example, an algorithm could analyze content posted and consumed to detect suicidal tendencies.

4. Chatbots
Getting queries directly from a customer representative can be very time-consuming. That’s where artificial intelligence comes in.

Computer scientists train chat robots or chatbots to impersonate the conversational styles of customer representatives using natural language processing.

Chatbots are currently being used by many businesses to assist potential customers with their queries. | 200degrees/Pixabay.com
Chatbots can now answer questions that require a detailed response in place of a specific yes or no answer. What’s more, the bots can learn from previous bad ratings to ensure maximum customer satisfaction.

As a result, machines now perform basic tasks such as answering FAQs or taking and tracking orders.

5. Recommendation Algorithm
Media streaming platforms such as Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify rely on a smart recommendation system that’s powered by AI.

First, the system collects data on users’ interests and behavior using various online activities. After that, machine learning and deep learning algorithms analyze the data to predict preferences.

That’s why you’ll always find movies that you’re likely to watch on Netflix’s recommendation. And you won’t have to search any further.

6. Search Algorithm
Search algorithms ensure that the top results on the search engine result page (SERP) have the answers to our queries. But how does this happen?

Search companies usually include some type of quality control algorithm to recognize high-quality content. It then provides a list of search results that best answer the query and offers the best user experience.

Google search
Search engines like Google is powered by multiple algorithms that help it match people’s queries with the best answers available online. | Google
Since search engines are made entirely of codes, they rely on natural language processing (NLP) technology to understand queries.

Last year, Google announced Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), an NLP pre-training technique. Now, the technology powers almost all English-based query on Google Search.

7. Digital Assistants
In October 2011, Apple’s Siri became the first digital assistant to be standard on a smartphone. However, voice assistants have come a long way since then.

Today, Google Assistant incorporates advanced NLP and ML to become well-versed in human language. Not only does it understand complex commands, but it also provides satisfactory outputs.

Also, digital assistants now have adaptive capabilities for analyzing user preferences, habits, and schedules. That way, they can organize and plan actions such as reminders, prompts, and schedules.

8. Smart Home Devices
Various smart home devices now use AI applications to conserve energy.

For example, smart thermostats such as Nest use our daily habits and heating/cooling preferences to adjust home temperatures. Likewise, smart refrigerators can create shopping lists based on what’s absent on the fridge’s shelves.

The way we use artificial intelligence at home is still evolving. More AI solution
<h1>Government Role</h1>
Artificial intelligence (AI) has a range of uses in government. It can be used to further public policy objectives (in areas such as emergency services, health and welfare), as well as assist the public to interact with the government (through the use of virtual assistants, for example). According to the Harvard Business Review, "Applications of artificial intelligence to the public sector are broad and growing, with early experiments taking place around the world."[1] Hila Mehr from the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at Harvard University notes that AI in government is not new, with postal services using machine methods in the late 1990s to recognise handwriting on envelopes to automatically route letters.[2] The use of AI in government comes with significant benefits, including efficiencies resulting in cost savings (for instance by reducing the number of front office staff), and reducing the opportunities for corruption.[3] However, it also carries risks.

Uses of AI in government
The potential uses of AI in government are wide and varied,[4] with Deloitte considering that "Cognitive technologies could eventually revolutionize every facet of government operations".[5] Mehr suggests that six types of government problems are appropriate for AI applications:[2]

Resource allocation - such as where administrative support is required to complete tasks more quickly.
Large datasets - where these are too large for employees to work efficiently and multiple datasets could be combined to provide greater insights.
Experts shortage - including where basic questions could be answered and niche issues can be learned.
Predictable scenario - historical data makes the situation predictable.
Procedural - repetitive tasks where inputs or outputs have a binary answer.
Diverse data - where data takes a variety of forms (such as visual and linguistic) and needs to be summarised regularly.
Meher states that "While applications of AI in government work have not kept pace with the rapid expansion of AI in the private sector, the potential use cases in the public sector mirror common applications in the private sector."[2]

Potential and actual uses of AI in government can be divided into three broad categories: those that contribute to public policy objectives; those that assist public interactions with the government; and other uses.

Contributing to public policy objectives
There are a range of examples of where AI can contribute to public policy objectives.[6] These include:

Black Mirror’ or better? The role of AI in the future of learning and development
The pros of artificial intelligence in learning — the speediness, customized content and targeted recommendations — outweigh the cons. However, learning leaders need to truly understand the technology, risks and critical approaches for mitigating those risks.

The hit TV anthology ‘Black Mirror’ has captivated viewers with speculative tales of how emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning and intelligent automation could go horribly awry. It makes for great television, but do similar futures await learning leaders who are looking to strategically leverage these technologies?

We have seen where AI-powered digital technologies are steadily and increasingly becoming part of our daily lives. Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, Google’s Assistant and Microsoft’s Cortana are accessible in many of our homes and through our digital devices. These and other AI agents are evolving and becoming more capable of completing processes humans are traditionally tasked with.

AI-driven technologies have the potential to enhance our lives as both learners and workers. Researchers and developers are continuously improving them to mimic human behaviors; they can learn, problem-solve and process language. Although they are becoming stronger imitators of humans, they still lack essential human traits such as wisdom, insight, humor and empathy. These are the traits that will ensure humans remain a critical part of the workforce for the foreseeable future.

How can AI be used in learning?

Businesses are using AI agents to engage customers, rapidly create content, analyze transactions and detect fraud. As organizations continue to transform their businesses with ML, we should consider how AI can transform learning and performance. Some of these tools have already entered the space; others have not, but are available in adjacent industries. These are just a handful:

Personalized learning recommendations: Social network platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have been using AI to personalize the news and advertisements a user receives based on preference or interest. The AI in these tools uses a wide range of variables to predict the reader’s interest. Learning experience platforms like Degreed and EdCast use comparable technology to drive their recommendation engines, proposing content that learners are likely to find relevant based on their demonstrated preferences.

Building a personal performance network: One of the most critical assets a new hire can build is a personal network within the organization to help them assimilate, grow and perform in their role. An AI agent could, for example, help a new employee navigate a large population to strategically identify a coach, a subject matter expert, a career mentor or an experienced peer who can help them learn more about their role and the organization, which leads to better business outcomes, whether that is customer service or delivering a product. A tool such as Starmind can help a company analyze and identify talent across an organization.

On-demand 24/7 learning assistance: Many companies have used AI bots to provide front-line digital customer engagement for years, and they have become quite effective in mimicking humans. There has been an increase in the use of bots in learning, but the practice is still emerging and not widely adopted or implemented. Imagine an advanced AI-assisted learning bot that not only could reason and interact to support a learner with immediate requests, but also could anticipate and provide resources across each of the moments of learning need.

An example: During a live Georgia Tech lecture class in 2016, a professor told his students that his teaching assistant , Jill Watson, would be available online to answer their questions throughout the duration of the semester-long course. Near the end of the class, the instructor revealed that Jill the TA was, in fact, a virtual AI bot. The students shared their surprise, and many thought she was a human; she was so responsive and helpful that some students felt they had developed a connection with her.

Productivity, networking and wellness-driven learning recommendations: With the rollout of Microsoft’s MyAnalytics in Office 365, many organizations who use the MS Suite now have access to this functionality. By tracking a worker’s activity through their calendar, email, collaboration sites, chat and web conferencing, an organization can begin to apply learning recommendations with surgical precision at the point of performance.

For example, an AI agent could identify that it’s been 90 days since the last performance review with one of a manager’s direct reports. The tool could send a reminder, help set a calendar meeting, pull notes from the last performance review, share best-practice videos to help them prepare and nudge the manager to record the completed performance review. Finally, a feedback bot could analyze a recording of the manager’s practice session — searching for triggers, microaggressions or other areas for improvement.

Adaptive learning to optimize/shorten the learning journey: This is a growing application in the learning space. Tools like Area9’s Rhapsode platform can streamline a learner’s path to performance, help uncover unconscious incompetence and reinforce the learning to offset the forgetting curve.

Improved accessibility: AI can help learning designers and developers create more accessible and seamless learning journeys from the point of design — rather than as an afterthought. Microsoft’s Seeing AI app or automatic transcripts in YouTube are examples of how learning content can be made more accessible. These features include text-to-speech and speech recognition.

Sourcing, analyzing, and generating draft content: An AI-assisted learning-development tool can search a variety of sources internally or externally to find content that is relevant to a particular learning or performance outcome. Digital marketers and online publishers have been using AI to generate content for simple stories for years now. Odds are you have read an online article or blog post created by a bot and didn’t even realize it. In the learning space, there are tools such as Emplay and IBM’s Watson that can support this. For example, let’s say a designer wants to create a quick microlearning on how a vacuum pump works. The designer could engage an AI bot to crawl internal or external networks for potential resources — including videos and images. The AI agent then analyzes them, aligning pieces to specific learning outcomes, prioritizing resources for relevance and tagging them by modality. Ultimately, this would free up the designer to focus more on learner-centric design and delivery.

What are the ethical and practical issues we should consider?

As you can see, there are many potential benefits to the adoption of AI in the learning space. However, before we invest in AI, it is important to first explore the risks and practical issues of adopting AI across the enterprise. Following are some of the key issues aligned to learning.

Employee/learner privacy: AI and the algorithms it is built on require data about learners. A learner’s preferences, behaviors, productivity and those they collaborate with can provide data that can be used to personalize learning and performance-support systems. However, there are serious questions about how this data is collected, stored, analyzed and applied. The potential exists for an organization to negatively use productivity data or collaboration data to promote, reward or fire an employee.

This becomes more significant when you include the ability to capture and search the audio from a recorded meeting. Almost instantaneously, you have a searchable record of everything said in a meeting, which is something not everyone is ready for.

Employee/learner security: The more information an AI agent has about individual workers or employees, the more that tool can be used to target a specific individual and exploit or harm them. For example, with access to the right data set, including training certifications, a bad actor could leverage an AI-driven talent analytics tool to strategically identify a specific human with a critical skill set and a personal vulnerability, like extremely high debt.

Inaccurate, outdated or intentionally false information (deepfakes): This comes from two directions. One way is through inbound data. Content recommended by AI tools can be compromised by accessing inaccurate data sets and including them as recommended information to a learner. These recommendations have all the earmarks of authentic, expert information, and it’s difficult for novices to know the difference. Another way is through the creation of AI agents to specifically create false information at scale to influence the behaviors of a population. An example of this is the challenge of sorting through scientific, evidence-based data collected from publicly accessible sites during the pandemic. Aggregator bots have had a difficult time differentiating scientifically validated information from intentional propaganda about the efficacy of masks and social distancing.

Algorithmic bias: The outputs are only as good as the data they are based upon. AI built by inherently biased humans can lead to biases in the algorithms; the data fed to train the algorithm may have biases in it, both of which can be amplified by the algorithm. For example, Amazon built an experimental AI tool to streamline the résumé-analysis process. The tool would review large batches of job applicants’ résumés to identify top talent.

Basically, the tool used AI to rate each résumé on a scale from one to five stars. As Amazon began working with the system, they realized the system was not rating candidates in gender-neutral ways. What they determined is that the data set of résumés they fed the system to train itself was predominantly male, aligning with the trend in the industry at the time that most people in the role were male. Essentially, the tool taught itself that male candidates were preferable. The tool was never used to evaluate real candidates and was abandoned.

What you can do to mitigate the risks

Ensure privacy and security: Balancing the need for data to fuel the AI engine with the learner’s right to privacy is a challenging topic, but it’s one that must be addressed. Although recent legislation has attempted to outline key components, the approaches continue to evolve. The following are a good start to apply to the learning context:

Transparency: Clearly identifying when you are interacting with an AI system that is collecting data about you.
Right to the information being collected: There is an established need and right to access the data.
Opting out: The ability for the learner to opt out of the system collecting data.
Built-in limits: The purpose and scope of data must be limited by design.
Automatic deletion: The learner’s data should be able to be deleted upon request.
Security: Any data collected must be always secure.
Remove, flag or tag inaccurate, outdated or intentionally fake information (deepfakes): Build in mechanisms to identify and eliminate inaccurate or misleading content. This strategy was implemented during the last U.S. presidential election on Facebook and Twitter.

Eliminate algorithmic bias: Ensure that the AI outputs are continuously evaluated to look for evidence of bias; continually train the algorithm to adjust as the environment and data set change. Working with a diverse team and a robust, bias-free data set will reduce the risk of bias.

Educate the humans: As users and consumers of AI outputs, learners must understand how their actions shape the recommendations they receive, evaluate the quality of information received, and know when and how to break out of the algorithm (e.g., when the need to innovate arises).

In the end, in the learning space, the pros of AI — the speediness, customized content and targeted recommendations — outweigh the cons. However, to ultimately avoid becoming the inspiration for a future “Black Mirror” episode, learning leaders need to truly understand the technology, risks and critical approaches for mitigating those risks.
